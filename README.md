# Landing Page Project

# Summary
A mock landing page with multiple sections built using just HTML, CSS and
Javascript. This project includes dynamic features such as a navbar and section
animations. When a section comes into the viewport, the background becomes
highlighted. The navbar is also dynamically generated according to the number
of sections on the webpage. The navlinks will collapse into a dropdown menu if
the screen is small.

## Usage
Just open `index.html` from any browser
